# Riddlebot for Discord!
    
A simple python riddlebot for discord, using Google Sheets and Heroku

## Current Comamnds
- `!riddle` gives a riddle
- `!answer answer` will get the bot to check your guess against the correct answer
- `!hint` will give a hint for the riddle, if applicable
- `!showanswer` will show the answer, and end the riddle
- `!forceriddle` will force the bot to end the current riddle and get a new one.
- `!addriddle` will give the user a link to a Google Form where they can submit more riddles to be added

`bot.py` starts up the bot, and all the code for the commands can be found in the `modules` directory.
